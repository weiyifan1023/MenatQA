In 1873 Adam collaborated with Wells , shortly before he left for Australia , on the decoration and glazing of Belhaven Parish Church , Glasgow .

Soon afterward , he began to score quick victories over his fellow WCW wrestlers in the range of 1\u20132 minutes . Goldbergs succession of wins saw him quickly advance up the card , and he was pushed as a singles wrestler . The newcomer captivated fans with his monstrous yet silent charisma , brute strength , and agility that saw him vault the ropes , perform high kicks and even the occasional backflip . Goldberg made his pay-per-view debut at Starrcade defeating Steve McMichael . In early 1998 , Goldberg squashed Brad Armstrong at SuperBrawl VIII and pinned Perry Saturn at Spring Stampede . By mid-March , WCW stopped referring to him by his full name , shortening it to simply Goldberg . Around this time , WCW began counting Goldbergs consecutive wins on television as he continued to climb up the ranks . Goldbergs win over Saturn was his 74th consecutive without a loss , and the next night on Nitro he challenged Raven for the United States Heavyweight Championship that Raven had won the night before at Spring Stampede . Despite interference from Ravens Flock , Goldberg overpowered them all and defeated Raven to win his first professional wrestling championship . Two days later on the April 22 episode of Thunder , he made his first successful title defense against Mike Enos . Goldberg then started a feud with Raven and The Flock . At Slamboree , he ended his feud with The Flock after a successful title defense against Saturn .

During the war , H\u00e5rsfj\u00e4rden and the Musk\u00f6 area became the southern center of the archipelago surrounded by minefields and air defenses , as well as an outer and inner defense line of coastal batteries . The bay between Vitsgarn and M\u00e4rsgarn became an important naval port where seaplane and submarine facilities were built . In 1944 , the Riksdag decided that the Swedish state would acquire Berga Castle after the late and large landowner Helge Ax:son Johnson . The area included a strip of water that stretched from Vits\u00e5 harbor to N\u00e4ringsberg and was 3.5 km long and 800 meters wide . In addition to the strip , there was also a part of the area where Berga Agricultural School was located , with an area of 1,025 hectares . The purchase price for the acquisition of the property was SEK 2,635,000 . The coastal strip was divided into naval port and naval schools . The hunting ground was transformed into a training area . The Berga Naval Training Schools started operating in 1946 , then as the Swedish Navy Non-Commissioned Officers School ( Marinens underofficersskola , MUOS ) .

Control was given to John de Seton until the English recaptured the castle from the Scots , hanging the defenders , and a larger garrison , this time numbering 54 , was installed . In 1313 the Scots regained control of the region . From there Tibbers Castle remained in Scottish hands , and was possessed by Thomas Randolph , 1st Earl of Moray .

When John died at the battle of Nevilles Cross in 1346 the earldom along with Tibbers Castle was given to Patrick , Earl of March . His son inherited in 1369 and acquired the barony of Morton which probably became the administrative centre for the barony of Tibbers . The estates descended through the Dunbar family until 1435 when their lands were confiscated by the Scottish Crown . In 1450 or 1451 , King James II of Scotland subsequently gave Tibbers to George Crichton , Lord High Admiral of Scotland and later the 1st Earl of Caithness .

    "annotated_para": "The death of Alexander III of Scotland in 1286 led to a succession crisis resulting in English rule of Scotland under Edward I . Robert the Bruces family was one of the claimants and in 1306 he was crowned king , leading to war with England . The first phase of Bruces campaign in 1306 was to capture the English-held castles of Ayr , Dalswinton , Inverkip and Tibbers . Control was given to John de Seton until the English recaptured the castle from the Scots , hanging the defenders , and a larger garrison , this time numbering 54 , was installed . In 1313 the Scots regained control of the region . From there Tibbers Castle remained in Scottish hands , and was possessed by Thomas Randolph , 1st Earl of Moray . He was succeeded by Thomas Randolph , 2nd Earl of Moray and John Randolph , 3rd Earl of Moray . When John died at the battle of Nevilles Cross in 1346 the earldom along with Tibbers Castle was given to Patrick , Earl of March . His son inherited in 1369 and acquired the barony of Morton which probably became the administrative centre for the barony of Tibbers . The estates descended through the Dunbar family until 1435 when their lands were confiscated by the Scottish Crown . In 1450 or 1451 , King James II of Scotland subsequently gave Tibbers to George Crichton , Lord High Admiral of Scotland and later the 1st Earl of Caithness . When he died in 1454 the property again came under royal control .",

    "annotated_para": "A multi-sport athlete during his college days at Transylvania College , Chandler briefly considered a career in professional baseball before deciding to pursue a law degree . After graduation , he entered politics and was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky Senate in 1928 . Two years later , he was elected lieutenant governor , serving under Governor Ruby Laffoon . Chandler and Laffoon disagreed on the issue of instituting a state sales tax and when Chandler , the presiding officer in the state senate , worked to block the legislation , Laffoons allies in the General Assembly stripped him of many of his statutory powers . The tax then passed by a narrow margin . Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention , Chandler waited until Laffoon left the state\u2014leaving Chandler as acting governor\u2014and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory primary election bill . The bill passed , and in the ensuing primary , Chandler defeated Laffoons choice , Thomas Rhea . He then went on to defeat Republican King Swope by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race at that time . As governor , Chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax , replacing the lost revenue with new excise taxes and the states first income tax . He also enacted a major reorganization of state government , realizing significant savings for the state . He used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the states education and transportation systems .",
